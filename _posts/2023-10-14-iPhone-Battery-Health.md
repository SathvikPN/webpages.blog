If you are concerned about the battery health of your iPhone, here are few tips to assist you!

### Charge Slowly

Electricity <--Battery--> Chemical Energy

Slow charging mean less strain on chemicals inside.

### Temperature

Maintain ambient temperature

Flammable chemicals are bound by thin battery cover and phone case.

Extreme high or low temparature affects chemicals activity

### Usage Patterns

Better to charge in `30%` to `80%` of capacity

Turn on `Optimised Charging` which slows down charging beyond `80%`

### Recommended Charger

Use recommended adapters and charging cables as suggested by phone manufacturer which controls the power output configuration

> A Li-ion battery has definite number of charge cycles which cannot be increased

```
How does few people able to get 100% battery health even after 1+ years usage ?

> batteries manufactured by different factories and even though have same size and chemicals used, quality is really hard to measure (flawed nature of measurement / imperfect technology)

- Might received high quality battery
- Might had capacity more than normal
- Might have used optimised charging practises like slow charging
- Might not be the heavy users
```
